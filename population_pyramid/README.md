# Population Pyramid for Dane County, Wisconsin (2020)

## Project Overview

This R script generates a population pyramid for Dane County, Wisconsin, based on 2020 U.S. Census data. The script uses the `tidycensus` package to pull data directly from the U.S. Census Bureau’s API and then processes the data to create a gender-specific population pyramid chart. The script is simple and effective for visualizing the distribution of age groups in the county’s population.

## Requirements

To run this project, you’ll need the following R packages:
- `tidycensus` - For accessing U.S. Census data through the API.
- `tidyverse` - Provides a collection of R packages for data manipulation, visualization, and more.
- `ggplot2` - For creating the population pyramid plot.
