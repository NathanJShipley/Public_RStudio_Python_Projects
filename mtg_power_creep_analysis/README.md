# Magic: The Gathering Power Creep Analysis

This project analyzes the evolution of power and toughness in Magic: The Gathering cards across the five colors from 2010 to the present. The primary goal is to explore potential power creep in the game, where card strength may increase over time. The analysis is performed using R, and the results are visualized through various graphs to highlight trends in power and toughness across different card sets.

## Project Overview

Magic: The Gathering has seen a long history of card releases, and some players have speculated about the potential for power creepâ€”the gradual increase in card strength over time. In this project, we investigate this potential power creep by analyzing the power and toughness of cards from the five colors (White, Blue, Black, Red, Green) that have been released since 2010.

The script processes the card data, extracting key features such as power and toughness values, and groups them by color. It then visualizes the change in power and toughness over time using graphs.

### Data & Analysis

The R script:
- Collects data on Magic: The Gathering cards, focusing on power and toughness values from new cards released since 2010
- Group the data by color to observe trends for each of the five colors
- Generates graphs to show how power and toughness have evolved over time

### Visualizations

The analysis generates various graphs to visualize:
- Power and toughness distributions for each color over time
- Changes in average power and toughness across sets
- Potential trends indicating power creep, if any, in the different colors

## Key Findings

While this is an exploratory analysis, the key findings may help reveal if certain colors are becoming progressively stronger or if any significant changes in card power have occurred since 2010.

## Next Steps

Further analysis could include:
- Investigating other metrics beyond power and toughness (e.g., abilities, mana costs) to see if they follow similar trends
- Comparing cards' power and toughness relative to their mana cost to get a better sense of overall balance
- Expanding the dataset to cover more card attributes and provide a deeper understanding of power creep in the game
